<H1>I was destined to be a performer...</H1>

From the time I was a youngster, I was always "acting up" with my family. I enjoyed
cracking jokes, singing, and clowning around. I did impersonations (Eartha Kitt for
a talent show) in overnight camp. I did taped interviews with my friends when my
father got a tape recorder. And because my parents were active in community theatre,
it was natural for me to join them. At the age of fourteen, I donned a set of green
tights and played a leprechaun in "Barnaby". I was a conspirator in "Julius Caesar",
a Russian Count in "Pygmalion" and an astronaut in "Night of the Auk". I was also a
criminal henchman in "The Night of January 16th" in high school.

After dropping out of art school, I worked for a couple of years as a professional
jeweler, then switched to high-tech. I started working in the aerospace industry, and
learned computers. I eventually discovered my artistic side could not be kept down,
and became a specialist in computer graphics.
</p>
Leaving aerospace, I made a major move from the East coast to the West and settled
in the Los Angeles area. My first job was in marketing for a graphics display
manufacturer. My company made the displays which created some of the images for
the original "Star Wars", and when I was sent to an industry conference the Summer
that "Star Wars" was released, I met one of the artists who worked on the scene of
the Death Star. I stepped forward the following Winter when our company was contacted
by Albert Brooks, who wanted some computer graphics for a movie he was making. I was
happy to oblige, and not only did my animated face appear on screen, I was an extra
in the scene which described how subjects were "tested" to participate in the project
that the movie's story was written around.

After <a href="/web/20160316183559/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079781/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"> <em>Real Life</em> </a> I worked for a couple of years at <em>Information International, Inc.</em> (also known as Triple-I)
in their Motion Picture Project group. There we created some amazing high-resolution CGI images,
and I got to work on two more feature films, <a href="/web/20160316183559/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082677/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"> <em>Looker</em> </a> (a Michael Crichton film starring Susan Dey, James Coburn and
Albert Finney) and <a href="/web/20160316183559/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/?ref_=nv_sr_2"> <em>TRON</em> </a> (the original Disney production featuring Beau Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner.)
