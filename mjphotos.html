<H3>This photo was taken in the Summer of 1962, in the New York City showroom of Luigi Chinetti.
They were the first importer of Ferrari to the U.S., and the North American
Racing Team was run from this location, which fielded Ferraris in major auto races since
the early 1950's.</H3>

The intended subject: Ray Bradbury, the noted Science-Fiction/Fantasy
author. Unfortunately, with this type of photo, the photographer tends
to dominate the scene...</H3>
